**8-Puzzle Solver Using Breadth-First Search Algorithm**

**8-Puzzle Solver**
This project implements an 8-Puzzle Solver, a sliding puzzle where tiles must be arranged in a specific order by sliding them into a blank space (represented by 0). It uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible configurations until the goal state is reached. The program allows user input for the starting configuration and checks if the puzzle is solvable before attempting a solution.
Once solved, it outputs the sequence of moves, indicating which tile was moved and in which direction.  
**Future Enhancements:**
Future improvements could include a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better user interaction, implementing more advanced search algorithms like A* for efficiency, and supporting larger puzzle sizes (e.g., 15-puzzle). Additionally, performance metrics could be added to track time and move count, as well as providing a comparison of different solving algorithms.
